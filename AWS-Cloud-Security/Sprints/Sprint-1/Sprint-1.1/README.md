# Sprint 1.1: AWS Networking and Security Groups Setup for Juice Shop Security Monitoring

**Author:** Oluwaseun Osunsola

This document details the steps performed to configure the AWS networking infrastructure and security groups for the "End-to-End Security Monitoring with Suricata IPS, AWS CloudWatch & Splunk on OWASP Juice Shop" project during Sprint 1.1 (Day 1). The goal was to establish a VPC, subnets, an internet gateway, route tables, and security groups to support the deployment of the OWASP Juice Shop and Suricata IPS. Each step is linked to a screenshot for reference.

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with permissions to create VPCs, subnets, internet gateways, route tables, and security groups.
- Familiarity with the AWS Management Console.

## Resources Created
### Networking
- **VPC**: `JuiceShop-VPC` (CIDR: `10.0.0.0/16`)
- **Public Subnet**: `Public-Subnet` (CIDR: `10.0.1.0/24`)
- **Private Subnet**: `Private-Subnet` (CIDR: `10.0.2.0/24`)
- **Internet Gateway**: `JuiceShop-IGW` (attached to `JuiceShop-VPC`)
- **Public Route Table**: `JuiceShop-Public-RT` (routes: local + `0.0.0.0/0 â†’ JuiceShop-IGW`)
- **Private Route Table**: `JuiceShop-Private-RT` (routes: local only)

### Security Groups
- **JuiceShop-WebSG** (for OWASP Juice Shop instance)
  - Inbound: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) from `0.0.0.0/0`; SSH (22) from your IP
  - Outbound: Allow All
- **JuiceShop-IPS-SG** (for Suricata IPS instance)
  - Inbound: HTTP/HTTPS from `JuiceShop-WebSG`; SSH (22) from your IP
  - Outbound: Allow All

## Outcome
The AWS networking infrastructure and security groups were successfully configured:
- **VPC**: `JuiceShop-VPC` with CIDR `10.0.0.0/16`.
- **Subnets**: `Public-Subnet` (`10.0.1.0/24`) and `Private-Subnet` (`10.0.2.0/24`).
- **Internet Gateway**: `JuiceShop-IGW` attached to `JuiceShop-VPC`.
- **Route Tables**:
  - `JuiceShop-Public-RT`: Routes local traffic and `0.0.0.0/0` to `JuiceShop-IGW`, associated with `Public-Subnet`.
  - `JuiceShop-Private-RT`: Routes local traffic only, associated with `Private-Subnet`.
- **Security Groups**:
  - `JuiceShop-WebSG`: Allows HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) from anywhere, SSH (22) from your IP.
  - `JuiceShop-IPS-SG`: Allows HTTP/HTTPS from `JuiceShop-WebSG`, SSH (22) from your IP.

This setup provides a secure and isolated network environment for deploying the OWASP Juice Shop and Suricata IPS in subsequent sprints.
