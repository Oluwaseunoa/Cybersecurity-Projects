Closed the JPS Virus Maker window after creating the virus.
![Close JPS Window](./img/15.close_jps_virus_maker_window.png)

## Step 16: Virus Executable Added to Folder
The virus executable (server.jpg) was added to the JPS folder on the Windows Server.
![Virus Executable Added](./img/16.server-jpg(executable)_added_to_the_jps_folder.png)

## Step 17: Log into the Victim Machine
Switched to the powered-on Windows 10 machine (victim) and logged in.
![Log into Windows 10](./img/17.switch_to_the_powerred_on_windows_10(target)_and_log_in.png)

## Step 18: Locate the Virus on the Network
Located the virus file (server.jpg) in the network folder shared by the Windows Server.
![Locate Virus on Network](./img/18.locate_the_virus-jpg(malware)_on_the_network_folder_shared_by_windows_server2022(the_attacker).png)

## Step 19: Execute the Virus
Executed the server.jpg file on the Windows 10 machine to trigger the virus.
![Execute the Virus](./img/19.execute_the_server-jpg.png)

## Step 20: Background Turns Black
Observed the Windows 10 desktop background turning black due to the virus.
![Background Turns Black](./img/20.background_turn_black.png)

## Step 21: Minimize to Observe the Issue
Minimized all windows to confirm the extent of the virus's impact on the system.
![Minimize to See Problem](./img/21.minimize_to_see_the_problem.png)

## Step 22: Screen Becomes Totally Black
The entire screen of the Windows 10 machine turned black, indicating a severe effect.
![Screen Totally Black](./img/22.the_screen_is_totally_black.png)

## Step 23: Roll Back to Last Snapshot
Initiated a rollback to the last snapshot of the Windows 10 machine to recover.

## Step 28: Normal Screen Restored with Data Loss
The Windows 10 screen returned to normal, but some data was lost due to the rollback.

## Additional Observations
During the project, the following issues were noted for transparency and to highlight learning opportunities:

- Despite disabling Windows Defender and its security functions using Group Policy Editor (gpedit) and the Windows Defender interface itself, the settings reverted upon rebooting the virtual machine. This occurred even without auto snapshot rollback enabled. It remains unclear whether the JPS Virus was responsible for this behavior. Multiple attempts were made to persistently disable the security features, but the issue persisted, leading to abandoning further efforts in this regard.

- The lockout configuration for the virus did not function as expected in most trials. Instead, only the black screen effect persisted for a period of time.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the creation and deployment of a virus using JPS Virus Maker in a controlled virtual environment, with the virus causing significant disruption by rendering the Windows 10 victim's screen black. The rollback to a pre-attack snapshot effectively restored system functionality, though it resulted in some data loss. The experiment highlighted the importance of snapshots for recovery and the role of network monitoring via the pfSense firewall. However, challenges with Windows Defender reverting to enabled status after reboots and inconsistent functionality of the virus's lockout configuration indicate limitations in the JPS Virus Maker tool or potential interactions with the virtual environment.

## Recommendations
1. **Investigate Windows Defender Reversion**: Further research is needed to understand why Windows Defender settings revert upon reboot. This could involve examining virtual machine configurations, Windows 10 policies, or potential interactions with JPS Virus Maker. Testing with alternative methods to disable Defender, such as registry edits or PowerShell scripts, may yield more persistent results.

2. **Enhance Virus Configuration Testing**: The inconsistent lockout functionality suggests that additional testing and debugging of JPS Virus Maker's configuration options are necessary. Future experiments should include multiple test runs with varied settings to identify reliable configurations or confirm limitations in the tool.

3. **Strengthen Recovery Mechanisms**: While snapshots proved effective, the data loss observed during rollback underscores the need for more robust backup strategies. Implementing automated, incremental backups before executing potentially destructive tests could minimize data loss.

4. **Improve Network Security Monitoring**: The pfSense firewall was powered on, but its logs were not analyzed in this project. Future experiments should include detailed firewall log analysis to better understand the virus's network behavior and enhance detection capabilities.

5. **Use Alternative Tools for Validation**: Given the limitations observed with JPS Virus Maker, exploring alternative malware simulation tools or frameworks could provide more consistent results and additional features for educational purposes. Tools like Metasploit or custom scripts in a controlled environment may offer better control and reliability.
